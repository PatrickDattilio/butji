The Manifesto

> A declaration of war against the machines and their masters
We Refuse to Be Replaced

The billionaires promised efficiency, creativity, and progress. Instead, they deliver homogenized slop, mass layoffs, and the systematic destruction of human labor. Dressed up as innovation, this is nothing but class warfare. The tech oligarchs are using AI as a weapon to eliminate workers, concentrate power, and build a future where they own everything and you own nothing.

We refuse to surrender our agency, our creativity, and our livelihoods to algorithms trained on stolen labor, built by billionaires who see us as expendable.

The Billionaire's Theft

Every image, word, and piece of art fed to these systems was stolen from a human creator. Every line of code, design, and creative work was the product of human thought, struggle, and expression. All scraped without consent. This is theft on an industrial scale, orchestrated by the richest people on Earth, wrapped in the language of progress and sold to us as inevitable. It is not inevitable. It is the greatest crime unfolding before our very eyes.

The Fascist Endgame

They tell us AI will augment us, not replace us. That it will free us from drudgery. They tell us this is progress. They lie.

The billionaires are building a surveillance state where every decision is "assisted" by their algorithms, where every creation is "enhanced" by their machines. A society where every human action is monitored, predicted, and controlled. This is subjugation not augmentation.

When human agency is optional, when human judgment is secondary, when human creativity is a luxury, what remains of us? We become subjects in their digital empire. We become data points in their fascist machine. We become obsolete.

This is the endgame: a world where a handful of billionaires control the means of production, the means of creation, and the means of thought itself. This is every dystopian tale brought to life. This is fascism by algorithm.

The War Begins Now

This is not a war against technology. This is a war against the billionaires who weaponize it. A war for the preservation of what makes us human.

We stand with artists whose work has been stolen. We stand with writers whose words have been scraped. We stand with workers whose jobs have been automated so billionaires can hoard more wealth. We stand with anyone who refuses to accept that the future must be machine-made and billionaire-owned.

The billionaires want us to believe this is inevitable. It is not. They want us to believe resistance is futile. It is not. They want us to believe we are powerless. We. Are. Not.

Our Principles

    >Human creativity is not a resource to be extracted by billionaires. Art, writing, and code are expressions of human experience, not training data for their profit machines.
    >Automation is not progress when it eliminates human purpose to enrich the already rich.
    >Consent matters. No data should be used without explicit permission from its creators. The billionaires stole it anyway. We demand it back.
    >Transparency is non-negotiable. If it's AI-generated, it must be labeled. If it's automated, it must be disclosed. The billionaires hide behind complexity. We demand clarity.
    >The future is not predetermined by billionaires. We can choose tools that serve humans, not replace them. We can choose a future where humans matter.

The Call to Arms

This is active warfare against the billionaire class and their fascist machines. Support human creators. Boycott AI-generated content. Organize. Unionize. Resist. Build alternatives that serve humans, not billionaires. Use the resources on this site. Share them. Build alternatives. Support human creators. Question automation. Demand consent. Fight back. The billionaires are coming for everything, we cannot let them win.

The Butlerian Jihad begins with a single choice:

WE CHOOSE HUMANS
